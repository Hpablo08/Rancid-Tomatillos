## Overview

This was a paired collaboration assigned in week 14 of the Turing School of Software and Design front-end engineering program. The goals of this group project were to:

* Gain competency with React fundamentals
* Create a multi-page UX using Router
* Test React components & asynchronous JS with Cypress
* Practicing refactoring 

Highlights:

* Accessibility: app is fully _tabbable_, and scored 100% on both Lighthouse and WAVE audits
*

## Getting Started

### Installation
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
<ol>
  <li>Fork this Repo</li>
  <li>Clone it down to your machine</li>
  <li>cd into the root of the project directory</li>
  <li>run npm install</li>
  <li>To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm start` in your terminal to start the local server. This runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.</li>
  <li> `npm test` launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests/) for more information.

`npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/) for more information.

`npm run eject`
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
  <li>Enter control + c in your terminal to stop the local server at any time.</li>
</ol>
